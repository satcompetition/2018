    <h1>SAT Competition 2018</h1>
    
<h2>Description of Tracks</h2>

The following tracks will be featured in 2018 SAT Competition.
<ol>
<li><b>Main Track</b> is the track of sequential SAT solvers. We will use 300-600 benchmark problems, the time limit will be 5000 seconds.
All solvers participating
in the Main track are required to provide certificates in both SAT and UNSAT cases. For more information about the
UNSAT certificates see <a href="certificates.html">this page</a>.<br/>
We encourage <b>Glucose hack</b> authors to participate in the main track. A prize will be awarded to the best
Glucose hack (based on Glucose 3.0). For more detals plase see <a href="hack.html">this page</a>
</li>

<li><b>Random SAT Track</b> is the track of SAT solvers good on randomly generated satisfiable instances.</li>
<li><b>Parallel Track</b> is the track of parallel SAT solvers designed for computers with multiple CPUs or CPU cores.</li>
<li><b>No-Limits Track</b> is a special track where solver source code and solution certificates are not required and portfolios of any nature are allowed. Only brand new benchmarks will be used
in this track.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Printing a model in case of a satisfiable instance is required for all tracks expect for "no-limits". UNSAT certificates (proofs) are required only in the main tracks.
</p>
<h2>Execution Environment</h2>
<p>All the tracks except for the Parallel Track will be run on the <a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/about.jsp">StarExec cluster</a>.
The time limit for solving an instance will be 5000 seconds (in each track). The solvers will be allowed to use up to 24GB of RAM.</p>

<p>The Parallel Track will be run on computers with Dual Socket
Xeon E5-2690 v3 (Haswell) : 12 cores per socket (24 cores/node), 2.6 GHz processors and
64 GB DDR4-2133 (8 x 8GB dual rank x8 DIMMS) main memory.
Hyperthreading is Enabled—48 threads (logical CPUs) per node.

Compute nodes lack a local disk, but users have access to a 32 GB /tmp
RAM disk to accelerate IO operations. Note that any space taken in
/tmp will decrease the total amount of memory available on the node.
If 8 GB of data are written to /tmp the maximum memory available for
applications and OS on the node will then be 64 GB − 8 GB = 56 GB.
</p>

<p>
<!-- The Incremental Library Track will be run on computers with 2 x Intel Xeon X5355 2.66 GHz (4-Core) processors and 24GB of RAM. -->
</p>
<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>In total we will distribute 13 prizes. One prize for the best Glucose hack and
3 prizes for each of the Main, Parallel, Random SAT, and No-Limits Tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st prize (solved the highest number of instances)</li>
<li>2nd prize </li>
<li>3rd prize </li>
</ul>
