<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<h4>Benchmark Submission</h4>
<p>
We would like to invite and encourage submissions of benchmarks and benchmark generators for all the tracks of the competition.
</p>
<p>
Each Main Track participant (team) is required to submit 20 new benchmark instances (not seen in previous competitions). 
At least 10 of those benchmarks should be "interesting": not too easy (solvable by MiniSat in a minute) or 
too hard (unsolvable by the participants own solver within one hour on a computer similar to the nodes of the 
<a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/machine-specs.txt">StarExec cluster</a>).
</p>
<p>
Please contact the organizers to discuss options in case the requirement seems difficult to fulfil.
</p>
<p>
Participants should submit benchmarks by emailing them to "organizers@satcompetition.org" with the 
subject "SAT Competition 2018 Benchmark Submission" and either a URL link or attachment of a single zip file containing the benchmarks.
</p>

<h4>Input and Output Format</h4>
<p>
Benchmarks have to be formatted according to the
<a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/2011/format-benchmarks2011.html">SAT Competition 2011
Benchmark Submission Guidelines</a>.
A benchmark description, using 
the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Proceedings style</a>,
should be submitted with each submitted benchmark family,
following the instructions for solver descriptions.
The benchmark descriptions will be made available similarly as the solver descriptions 
(see <a href="index.php?cat=rules">general rules</a>).
</p>

<h4>Benchmark Selection</h4>
<p>
The benchmark problems will be selected randomly from the set of benchmarks submitted by the participants and by the organizers.
The benchmarks submitted by the participants will be scrambled and/or modified by applying satisfiability preserving transformations.
</p>
<!--
<p>
The benchmarks for the Incremental Library Track are applications using a SAT solver in an
incremental fashion. See the <a href="index.php?cat=incremental">Incremental Library Track Rules</a> section for more information.
